# Whisper-ASR--Federated-Learning

In the provided code, a Federated Learning system is implemented using the FLOWER library, consisting of a server and two clients.

The MNIST dataset has been used for this learning. 

I have used non iid datasets to show how clients with different data distributions can participate in federated learning, making it more efficient.

config (no. of rounds) has been set to 4.
after each round, we can see increase in the accuracy of the global model.
