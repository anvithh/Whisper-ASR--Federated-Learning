# telugutest.py
This is a python code which is used for predicting the resulting text for an audio. It is performed by taking openai/whisper-tiny model from hugging face. Where the code even resamples if the audio frequency
is not equal to 16000 because whisper has been trained for audio frequency 16000Hz.
I have used female voices dataset from  OpenSLR SLR66.
The model is giving the output as english text where the output needs to be in telugu. So, code should be changed such that it gives telugu text as output.
I have taken 2 rows from dataset to demonstrate what is happening. (demotest.png)
#telugutrain.py
This is a python code which is used for training the pretrained model using custom dataset. It is performed by taking openai/whisper-tiny model. So, for training I used the female voices dataset from OpenSLR SLR666.
While executing we are mapping processed data as custom_dataset. processed data contains list of attributed which are labels: which stores transcription id, audio which stores waveform, sampling rate which stores 
sample rate. 
But the error is occurring at the statement trainer.train(). Which needs to be checked out.
The error is demonstarted taking same 2 rows from dataset. (demotrain.png)
